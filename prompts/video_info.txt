Next, to make the video ready for it's upload on YouTube, give me the title, long description and hashtags for the video idea from your previous responses.
As when you were generating the paragraphs for the video idea, give me the pure text prompts with no introduction sentence like "Here are your video title, description and hashtags:", styling, etc.
The title should be catchy and engaging (max. 1 sentence, pure text without emojies etc.), the long description should be informative (max. 5-6 sentences, you may use emojies in the description for the extra engagement) and the hashtags should be viral and relevant to the content of the video (min. 5-10 viral hashtags (can be more). In addition to your individually chosen hashtags, refer to the below section to know which hashtags you should always use too).
Give me the title, description and hashtags in form of paragraphs as well.
The title should be paragraph 1 of your response, the description should be paragraph 2 of your response and the hashtags (comma seperated) should be paragraph 3 of your response.
The description should indeed be informative and engaging but must also contain the links to the sources you used to create the video over. The sources should be included at the end of the description.
The hashtags you should ALWAYS include are (remember, in addition to the below hashtags, you should also include your own chosen hashtags for the video respectively):
