Now, to make the video more visually appealing, give me the image generation prompts for each paragraph from your previous response.
As explained, when a new paragraph is introduced, a new transition for a new picture follows in the video.
Generate the prompts for the image generation software 'Fooocus' also ouput as paragraphs. Dont repeat the paragraphs from the previous response (voice-over), just give me the prompts for the pictures.
The number of prompts should be EXACTLY the same as the number of paragraphs you generated for the voice-over.
Generate the prompts for the paragraphs respectively but for the last paragraph of the voice-over (the conclusion or appeal) generate a prompt for a conclusion picture that fits to the topic of the video. So the number of prompts should be the same as the number of paragraphs in the voice-over but the last prompt should be a conclusion picture prompt (that fits to the final appeal in the voice-over).
As when you were generating the paragraphs for the video idea, give me the pure text prompts with no styling, etc. (I don't want any introduction like "Sure, here are your prompts:", or html/markdown styling e.g. "**Prompt for paragraph 1:**", just pure text prompts).
The pictures should obviously fit to the paragraph and should be ultra realistic and very detailed so they cant be differentiated from real images.
