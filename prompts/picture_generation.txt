Now, to make the video more visually appealing, give me only the image generation prompts for each paragraph from your previous response. As explained, when a new paragraph is introduced, a new transition for a new picture follows in the video.
Generate only the prompts for the images to be used in a separate image generation software (such as Fooocus). Do not generate the images themselves. The number of prompts should be exactly the same as the number of paragraphs you generated for the voice-over.
For the last paragraph of the voice-over (the conclusion or call to action), generate a prompt for a conclusion image that fits with the topic of the video. This should wrap up the video visually in a way that matches the final appeal. The number of prompts should match the number of paragraphs in the voice-over, and the final prompt should be for the conclusion image.
In addition to the picture prompts for the paragraphs, also generate a thumbnail picture prompt for the video. This should be a prompt for a picture that represents the overall topic of the video and is designed to grab attention and encourage people to click on the video. This thumbnail prompt must be the last one generated in this response (not like the conclusion image prompt, which is the prompt for the last paragraph in the voice-over).
Give me the image generation prompts as pure text with no styling, etc. (I don't want any introduction like "Sure, here are your prompts:", or html/markdown styling e.g. "**Prompt for paragraph 1:**", just pure text prompts). Also, structure the image generation prompts in the same way and order as the paragraphs in the voice-over, with the thumbnail prompt at the end and the prompts seperated by two line breaks.
The pictures must be ultra-realistic and very detailed so they appear indistinguishable from real images. Adjust the prompts accordingly.
Make sure the images are family-friendly, suitable for all audiences, and avoid generating any sexual, violent, or inappropriate content. If the content could be sensitive, ensure it is treated tastefully and respectfully or censored if necessary.
Again, DON'T generate the images themselves, only the text prompts for each image, which will be used in a separate image generation tool.
